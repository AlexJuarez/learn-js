# Trie

You are going to implement a stack that extends `Trie` from `./interfaces`. Feel free to use other data structures you have already implemented.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add(word)` | adds a word to the trie |
| `remove(word)` | removes a word from the trie |
| `suggestNextCharacters(word)` | returns an array of valid next characters from the word |
| `has(word)` | does the trie contain the word |
| `getLastNode(word)` | return the leaf node from word |
| `toString()` | returns a string representation of the trie, `testword` -> `*:t:e:s:t:w:o:r:d*` |
